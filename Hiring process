The process of hiring applicants involves several steps.

Firstly, applicants are required to sign up using a designated application link, such as http://apply.reveltek.com/.

Once the applicant has signed up, their information will be reviewed and listed. 

The next step is to send the applicant an email to inform them about the screening interview process. 
However, before scheduling the interview, it is important to clarify a few points with the applicant. 
Once these questions have been answered, a follow-up email should be sent, requesting the applicant to complete the attached test package and read the material provided. 

After this step, a screening interview can be scheduled using a calendar application such as MS Teams. The applicant should be invited to this meeting. 

After the screening interview has been conducted, all relevant information about the applicant should be indicated in Excel sheets for easy reference.
